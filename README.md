# Tuffybrain
Visual Studio Theme inspired by Jetbrains with better accesible colors âœ¨

![Preview](./docs/preview.png)

## Installation
1. Go to `Extensions: Install extension` using the Command Palette(`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
2. Search for `Tuffybrain`.
3. Click install.
4. From the Command Palette go to `Preferences: Color Theme` and find Tuffybrain.
5. Pick your favorite theme.
6. Enjoy!

## Preferences
For a better UI experience I recommend to disable `Activity Bar` and use only the command palette. If you like Jetbrains products you can [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and use the `Jetbrains Mono Font`.

Enable Ligatures to enjoy the whole experience:
```
"editor.fontFamily": "Jetbrains Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```
